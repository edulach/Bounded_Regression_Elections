To run the scripts, you will need the STAN program through the RStan package (see details in Guo, J., Gabry, J., Goodrich, B., & Weber, S.2020).

File description:
Follow files and folders
Application.elec.R: Contain all the packages required for the Bounded regression model. Two main datasets are important for the model: Elections of the circunscription and Human development indicators or covariates to analyze the factors from Principal Component Analysis.

Aux.functions.elec.R: Contain auxiliary functions created in R which are used to facilitate the transformations data, measures involved in the PCA like scores, loadings, and cumulated variances, and different Bayesian criterias for best fit.  

Stan models: four different Bounded regression models were developed, null, mean, precision and full model involved to each of the parameters of Beta regression. 

Results Peru, Results Brazil, Results Chile : results of the estimates are stored as results generated by the Application.elec.R program for the elections Peru 2021, Brazil 2022 and Chile 2021.

Instructions for Executing R and Rstan Codes
1. Open the file Application.elec.R and run the script in R considering the two main datasets( vote elections and IDH)
   
2. Note the default for the Stan model as the datasets is small,  iter = 5000, chains = 1, seed = 1234 and weak prios for the parameters:
  alpha ~ normal(0, 100); 
  epsilon ~ normal(0, 100);
  delta~ normal(0, 100);
  beta ~ normal(0, 100);  // Prior for regression coefficients
