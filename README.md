## Previous installations

- To run the scripts, you will need the STAN software through the RStan package. For installation details, refer to:
Guo, J., Gabry, J., Goodrich, B., & Weber, S. (2020). Package ‘rstan’. URL https://cran. r―project.

## File description:

Follow files and folders
- Application.elec.R: Contains all required packages for the bounded regression model. The two main datasets used in the model are:

Election results by constituency.

Human development indicators (or other covariates) used for factor analysis via Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

- Aux.functions.elec.R: Includes auxiliary R functions that facilitate data transformations and PCA computations, such as scores, loadings, cumulative variance, and Bayesian criteria for model selection. 

- Stan Models: Four bounded regression models were developed:

Null model

Mean model

Precision model

Full model (including all parameters of the Beta regression)

- Contains the estimated election results for Peru (2021), Brazil (2022), and Chile (2021) generated by Application.elec.R, stored in .txt format.
  
## Instructions for Running R and RStan Codes
1. Open Application.elec.R in R and execute the script, ensuring the two main datasets (election votes and Human Development Index) are available.
   
2. The default settings for the Stan model, given the small dataset size, are:

iter = 5000
chains = 1
seed = 1234

Weak priors for the parameters:
  alpha ~ normal(0, 100); 
  epsilon ~ normal(0, 100);
  delta~ normal(0, 100);
  beta ~ normal(0, 100);  // Prior for regression coefficients
